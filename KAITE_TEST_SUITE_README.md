## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests Failing with Low Scores**
- Check if kAIte's responses include expected elements
- Verify CTA buttons are properly configured
- Review response time performance

**Cron Job Not Running**
- Check cron service status: `systemctl status cron`
- Verify cron job exists: `crontab -l`
- Check log files for errors

**Dashboard Not Loading**
- Ensure test results exist in `test-results/` directory
- Check API endpoint accessibility
- Verify file permissions

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with verbose logging
DEBUG=kaite-tests node scripts/run-kaite-tests.js

# Test specific category
node scripts/run-kaite-tests.js --category trip_fit
```
