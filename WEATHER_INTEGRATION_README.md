# üå§Ô∏è AI-Powered Wind Condition Integration

## Overview
This implementation adds real-time weather and wind condition data to the booking process, helping customers make informed decisions about their kite safari trips.

## Features

### üéØ Smart API Usage
- **Limited API Calls**: Weather data is only fetched in the final step of the booking process (Step 3)
- **Intelligent Caching**: 10-minute cache to prevent redundant API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when weather data is unavailable

### üìä Weather Data Display
- **Current Conditions**: Real-time wind speed, direction, temperature, and humidity
- **6-Hour Forecast**: Hourly wind conditions for the next 6 hours
- **Kiteboarding Assessment**: AI-powered wind condition analysis with recommendations
- **Expandable View**: Users can view detailed forecast or compact summary

### üó∫Ô∏è Multi-Destination Support
- **Sardinia**: Punta Trettu (39.112, 8.437)
- **Antigua**: (17.0608, -61.7964)
- **Barbados**: (13.1939, -59.5432)
- **Grenada**: (12.1165, -61.6790)
- **St. Lucia**: (13.9094, -60.9789)
- **Dominica**: (15.4150, -61.3710)
- **St. Vincent**: (13.2528, -61.1971)
- **Tobago**: (11.1800, -60.7200)
- **Trinidad**: (10.6918, -61.2225)

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- **`WeatherConditions`**: Main weather display component
- **`/api/weather`**: Backend API endpoint with caching
- **Stormglass Service**: Weather data provider integration

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/weather
{
  "destination": "Sardinia",
  "coordinates": { "lat": 39.112, "lng": 8.437 },
  "hours": 6
}
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Duration**: 10 minutes per location
- **Storage**: In-memory cache (production: Redis recommended)
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old entries (max 100)

## Wind Condition Assessment

| Wind Speed | Condition | Recommendation |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| < 8 kts | Light | May need larger kites |
| 8-15 kts | Moderate | Good for intermediate riders |
| 15-25 kts | Good | Perfect for kitesurfing |
| 25-35 kts | Strong | Experienced riders only |
| > 35 kts | Very Strong | Consider postponing |

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration
Add to your `.env.local`:
```bash
STORMGLASS_API_KEY=your_stormglass_api_key_here
```

### 2. Get Stormglass API Key
1. Visit [Stormglass.io](https://stormglass.io/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add it to your environment variables

### 3. Test the Integration
1. Navigate to `/booking`
2. Complete steps 1 and 2 of the booking process
3. In step 3, you'll see the weather conditions component
4. Verify that weather data loads correctly

## Usage in Booking Flow

### Step 1: Trip Details
- User selects destination and dates
- No weather API calls made

### Step 2: Guest Information
- User enters guest details
- No weather API calls made

### Step 3: Review & Book
- **Weather component appears**
- **API call made only now**
- User sees current conditions and forecast
- User can make informed booking decision

## Error Handling
